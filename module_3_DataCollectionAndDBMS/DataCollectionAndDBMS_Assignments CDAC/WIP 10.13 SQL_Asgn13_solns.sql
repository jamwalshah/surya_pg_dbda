-- Assignment – 13
-- Using the UNION clause.




-- 1) Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and 
-- ratings of all customers. Those with rating of 200 or greater will also 
-- have the words “High Rating”, while the others will have the words “Low Rating”.


-- 2) Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson 
-- and each customer with more than one current order. Put the results in 
-- alphabetical order.


-- 3) Form a union of three queries. 
-- 		Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in San Jose; 
-- 		the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; 
-- 		and the third the onums
-- 		of all orders on October 3. 
-- 	Retain duplicates between the last two queries but
-- 	eliminate any redundancies between either of them and the first.
-- 	(Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. 
-- 	This is besides the point.).
