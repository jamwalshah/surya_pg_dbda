-- Creating Tables and Indexes.




-- 1) Write a command that will enable a user to pull orders grouped by 
-- date out of the Orders table quickly.


-- 2) If the Orders table has already been created, how can you force 
-- the onum field to be unique (assume all current values are unique)?


-- 3) Create an index that would permit each salesperson to retrieve 
-- his or her orders grouped by date quickly.


-- 4) Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer 
-- of a given rating, and that this is currently the case. 
-- Enter a command that enforces it.
