-- same onum, amt and snum fields as the Orders table, and the 
-- same cnum and city fields as the Customers table, so that each

-- or her city. Onum will be the primary key of Cityorders. 
-- All of the fields in Cityorders will be constrained to match the 
-- Customers and Orders tables. Ensure the parent keys in these
