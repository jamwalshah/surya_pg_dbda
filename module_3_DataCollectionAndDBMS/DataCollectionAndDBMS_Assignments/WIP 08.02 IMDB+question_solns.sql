/* Now that you have imported the data sets, let’s explore some of the tables. 
 To begin with, it is beneficial to know the shape of the tables and whether any column has null values.
 Further in this segment, you will take a look at 'movies' and 'genre' tables.*/



-- Segment 1:




-- Q1. Find the total number of rows in each table of the schema?
-- Type your code below:









-- Q2. Which columns in the movie table have null values?
-- Type your code below:









-- Now as you can see four columns of the movie table has null values. Let's look at the at the movies released each year. 
-- Q3. Find the total number of movies released each year? How does the trend look month wise? (Output expected)

/* Output format for the first part:
