-- Constraining the Values of your data.




-- 1) Create the Orders table so that all onum values as well as all 
-- combinations of cnum and snum are different from one another, and so that 
-- NULL values are excluded from the date field.


-- 2) Create the Salespeople table so that the default commission is 10% with 
-- no NULLS permitted, snum is the primary key, and all names fall alphabetically 
-- between A and M, inclusive (assume all names will be uppercase).


-- 3) Create the Orders table, making sure that the onum is greater than the 
-- cnum, and the cnum is greater that the snum. Allow no NULLS in any of these 
-- three fields.
