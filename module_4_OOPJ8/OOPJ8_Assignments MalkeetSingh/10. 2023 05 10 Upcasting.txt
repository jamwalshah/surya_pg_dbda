You are working on a project for a company that manages employee records. 
There are different types of employees, such as full-time employees, part-time employees, 
and contractors. Each type of employee has different attributes and methods.

Write a Java program that demonstrates the concept of upcasting in this scenario. 
Create a base Employee class with common attributes such as name, id, and hourly rate. 
Create derived classes for each type of employee and override the base class methods with their own implementations.
In the main method, create objects of the different types of employees and upcast them to the Employee class
