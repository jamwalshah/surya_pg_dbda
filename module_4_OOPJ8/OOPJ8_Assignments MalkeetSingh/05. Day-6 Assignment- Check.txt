1.  Create a Java program that demonstrates the use of constructor chaining to initialize objects of a class hierarchy. 
The program should consist of the following classes:A superclass called "Vehicle" with the following fields:
	a. make (string)
	b. model (string)
	c. year (integer)
	d .color (string)

2. The "Vehicle" class should have the following constructors:
	a. A default constructor that initializes all fields to empty or zero values.
	b. A parameterized constructor that takes values for all fields.
	c. A constructor that takes only the make, model, and year fields and sets the color to "unknown".

3. A subclass called "Car" that extends "Vehicle" and adds the following fields:
	a. numDoors (integer)
	b. automatic (boolean)

4. The "Car" class should have the following constructors:
	a. A default constructor that calls the default constructor of its superclass and sets 
		the "numDoors" and "automatic" fields to default values.
	b. A parameterized constructor that takes values for all fields and calls the parameterized 
		constructor of its superclass.
	c. A constructor that takes only the make, model, and year fields and sets the 
		"numDoors" and "automatic" fields to default values, and calls the corresponding 
		constructor of its superclass.

5. A subclass called "Truck" that extends "Vehicle" and adds the following fields:
	a. payloadCapacity (double)
	b. towingCapacity (double)

6. The "Truck" class should have the following constructors:
	a. A default constructor that calls the default constructor of its superclass and sets 
		the "payloadCapacity" and "towingCapacity" fields to default values.
	b. A parameterized constructor that takes values for all fields and calls the 
		parameterized constructor of its superclass.
	c. A constructor that takes only the make, model, and year fields and sets 
		the "payloadCapacity" and "towingCapacity" fields to default values, and 
		calls the corresponding constructor of its superclass.
