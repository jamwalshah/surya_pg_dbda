# Topics:
------------------
	-Classification Algorithm
	-Naive Bayes
	-Decision Tree
	
# Probability Language:
-----------------------
	Event: is a result that an outcome may occur
	
	Probability: is a value between 1 and 0 that an event will occur
	
	certain: means an event will occur and has a probability of 1
	
	uncertain: means an event won't occur and has a probability of 0
	
	Even chance: means there is a 50:50 chance of the event occurring


# Conditional Probability:
-------------------------
	P(A/B) : Probability of A given B
	
	P(AnB) : Probability of A and b intersection
	
	P(B) : Probability of B
