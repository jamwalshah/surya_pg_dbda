# Learning:
    -acquiring knowledge or skills through experience, study, or being taught.


# Machine Learning:(T,E,P)
    -A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of Task T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks T as measured by P, improves with experience E.


# Types of Machine Learning:
     1. Supervised
     2. Unsupervised
     3. Reinforcement
